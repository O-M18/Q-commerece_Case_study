## Key Learnings

- **Smaller data is better for fast prototyping**: I initially created 900k+ rows, which overloaded Power BI. Keeping data realistic improved performance.
- **Understand table dependencies**: Creating clean relationships between tables helped make accurate calculations and DAX measures.
- **Align units across metrics**: Turnover ratio required converting COGS (₹) to unit-level using cost, not price.
- **Unit Cost ≠ Unit Price**: This was a critical distinction in calculating profitability and inventory metrics.
- **Insights > Aesthetics**: A beautiful dashboard means nothing without clear, actionable insights.

## Outcome

- ✅ Interactive Power BI dashboard  
- ✅ City and SKU level insights  
- ✅ 4 strategic business recommendations  
- ✅ Improved understanding of inventory-led analytics in fast-paced businesses
